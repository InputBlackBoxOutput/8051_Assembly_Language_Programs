This folder contains multiple .asm files. These files contain the assembly language 
code for interfacing a stepper motor with an 8051 architecture microcontoller in 
various stepping modes.  

A .hex file can be generated and downloaded onto an AT89S52 uC. Pin connections have
been specified in comments of the .asm file. Please note that the external crystal
frequency is 11.0592 MHz and a stepper motor cannot be directly connected to the uC 
pins.
